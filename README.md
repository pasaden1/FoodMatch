 ============== FoodMatch Android App ==============  

This is the final year college project of Kristiyan Kyosev. 
FoodMatch is an android app which aims to assist the user in finding and ordering desired meal.
It has a swappable interface which makes browsing through the images much easier and fun.
For demonstration purposes only a few dishes are loaded from the database

Functionality
When started , the app is connecting with Firebase and downloads the meals stored in the specific node of the database and shows a stack of cards with random dish. The user can swipe left to reject the dish or right if he is interested. Swiping right opens 3 new options â€“ order the dish, save it for later, or rearrange the stack to see similar dishes from the same category.
The settings panel lets the user to refine his choices and the order page let`s him place the order , which is recorded in the database and can be instantly displayed on a web based application.
